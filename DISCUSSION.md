In future I’d like to

1. Perform lazy loading on the table because we cant be fetching 100,000 users each time.
2. Make headers clickable to permit sorting by the selected column (in both directions)
3. Always see the header row when scrolling - make the table header in a fixed position so it scrolls down as the user scrolls OR only make table content scrollable
4. Import Solace fonts and colors & Light/dark mode support with a theme system
5. Familiarize myself with drizzle to fix the type error in /seed, documentation doesn’t match the implementation.
